# Multimodal-model-
A robust and scalable video analysis and summarization system powered by LLaMA. It segments input videos into 10-second intervals, performs frame-level feature extraction (pose, object, motion) using advanced computer vision techniques, and generates context-aware summaries for each segment. Ideal for integration as intelligent video summarization.
